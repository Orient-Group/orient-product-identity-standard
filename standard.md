# 🎖️ Standard

The ONS introduces a **universal 4-part format** (with slight segment-specific tweaks) that applies across all categories:

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-04-04 at 2.16.16 PM.png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This format ensures:

* All names are human-readable and system-compatible
* All fields are clearly defined
* No field exceeds 8 characters
* Words used are real English words (no symbols, abbreviations, or invented terms)
