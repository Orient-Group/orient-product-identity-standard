description: Why the Orient Product Identity Standard was created
---

# 🎯 Purpose

In the past, product naming across Orient divisions was inconsistent, overly technical, and often disconnected from both the end user and the brand. Product names were treated more like internal codes than consumer-facing identities.

For example, an air conditioner named **“OS-19 K7 WG IN-HC”** was extremely difficult for a customer to understand — and even worse, it gave room for misrepresentation. In one case, a **18000 BTU** unit was misrepresented by a salesman as a **19000 BTU** model simply because of the “19” in the code. This led to mismatched expectations and erosion of trust.

### 🧩 The Problem

* **Customers couldn’t recall or relate to product names.**\
  When they entered a shop, they couldn't confidently ask for the exact item they had seen or wanted. This gave excessive leverage to dealers or salesmen to switch the sale to another brand or lower-spec product.
* **Internal teams used cryptic or misleading codes.**\
  Some divisions used ambiguous model codes that even sales staff couldn’t explain accurately, let alone customers. This often created confusion between specs, models, and pricing.
* **Expectations were misaligned with reality.**\
  When model names misrepresented specs — intentionally or not — it resulted in poor customer satisfaction, complaints, and broken trust.

### ✅ The Purpose of OPIS

OPIS was built to change this — by creating **a unified, transparent, and easy-to-understand system** for product naming and presentation.

It ensures that:

* Every Orient product has a name that is **easy to speak, remember, and recognize**
* Customers can **walk into a store and ask for the exact product they need** without any guesswork
* Sales teams and dealers cannot exploit technical confusion or ambiguous model structures
* Internal and external stakeholders use the **same structured language** across packaging, catalogs, systems, and customer touchpoints

Ultimately, **OPIS is a customer-first framework** that protects the integrity of Orient’s products, improves retail experience, and strengthens brand trust.
