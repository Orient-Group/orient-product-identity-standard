# ðŸ§¾ State of Current Nomenclature

Before ONS, each product division at Orient used its own ad hoc naming conventions, resulting in:

* Inconsistent naming structures
* Non-intuitive product names
* Errors in product registration, packaging, and listings
* Difficulty for dealers and end customers to differentiate models

### Examples of old formats:

<table><thead><tr><th width="215.375">Item</th><th>Model</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Tile</td><td>FL MARMI MARFIL SM 600X1200 IV L</td></tr><tr><td>Air Conditioner</td><td>OS-13MF04 GF-R410-ID</td></tr><tr><td>Refrigerator</td><td>OR-5535 GL GNNF RD LV</td></tr></tbody></table>

These names were hard to read due to their complex structure and unconventional spellings, difficult to sell because they lacked market appeal and recognizability, and challenging to manage owing to their unfamiliarity and lack of consistency across different systems.
