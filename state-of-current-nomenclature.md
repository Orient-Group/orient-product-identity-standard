# ðŸ§¾ State of Current Nomenclature

Before ONS, each product division at Orient used its own ad hoc naming conventions, resulting in:

* Inconsistent naming structures
* Non-intuitive product names
* Errors in product registration, packaging, and listings
* Difficulty for dealers and end customers to differentiate models

Examples of old formats:

* Refrigerator: OR-5535 GL GNNF RD LV
* Air Conditioner: OS-13MF04 GF-R410-ID
* Tile: FL MARMI Marble KARAKORAM WHITE WT 600X1200 VL RK

These names were hard to read, sell, and manage.
