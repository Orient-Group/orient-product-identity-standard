# ðŸ“˜ Introduction

The **Orient Product Identity Standard (OPIS)** is a unified framework that defines how Orient products are named, categorized, and communicated â€” across all divisions, channels, and customer touchpoints.

Where past naming conventions were fragmented and inconsistent, OPIS establishes a consistent structure that is easy to read, recall, and scale â€” not only internally but also for dealers and end customers.

OPIS is more than a naming guide. It is a **language system** that shapes how products are presented in:

* ERP and inventory systems
* Sales and dealer catalogs
* Packaging and labels
* E-commerce listings and marketing material

By aligning these areas, OPIS ensures that every Orient product speaks the same language â€” one of clarity, simplicity, and brand consistency.

### ðŸ§© What OPIS Covers

* **Standardized Product Naming Formats**
* **Approved Terminologies** (for categories, designs, surfaces, colors)
* **Theming Guidelines** for product collections
* **Segment-Specific Rules** (tiles, apparel, electronics, etc.)
* **Smart & Special Feature Encoding**

OPIS ensures that whether itâ€™s a smart air conditioner, a vest, or a faucet â€” every product speaks **the same visual and verbal language** across every customer and team interaction.
