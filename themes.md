# ðŸŒˆ Themes

In some cases, product naming across a segment or collection may follow a specific theme. These themes help bring consistency, storytelling, and distinction across a group of products â€” and are also reflected on product packaging and marketing communication.

Themes may be applied:

* To an entire **product category** (e.g., all glass-door refrigerators)
* To a specific **launch year or collection** (e.g., LED TVs of 2017)

### ðŸŽ¨ Examples of Themed Naming

**Big Cat Theme â€“ LED TVs (2017 Collection):**

* Lion 32 FHD Black
* Tiger 40S FHD Silver
* Puma 50 4K Black

**Precious Stones Theme â€“ Glass Door Refrigerators:**

* Ruby 260 Hairline Silver
* Quartz 330 Hairline Silver
* Diamond 470 Hairline Silver

Themes should be approved at the brand level and applied consistently across the relevant SKUs.
