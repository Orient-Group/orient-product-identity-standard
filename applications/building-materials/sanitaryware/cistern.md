# üö∞ Cistern

### üß© About Product

Orient cisterns are compact ceramic or plastic water tanks used to control flushing in toilets. They may be mounted on the wall or integrated with WCs. Cisterns vary by flush type (single, dual), visibility (exposed/concealed), and add-on features (soft button, smart sensor). OPIS naming ensures that these variations are captured in a simple, structured, and customer-friendly naming format.
